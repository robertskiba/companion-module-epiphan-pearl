## [Unreleased]

### Important

- Requires Companion 4.3 or newer
- The option "Use API v2.0" was removed. The module now automatically uses the best connection method for the firmware of your Pearl.
- "Get layout data" no longer asks for a custom variable. Choose where to store the result directly in Companion, like for other actions that return a value. Existing buttons are converted automatically.

### New Features

- If your Pearl runs a firmware older than 4.24.1, the connection shows a warning recommending a firmware update
- If the Pearl is not reachable, the module tries to reconnect every 10 seconds
- The Pearl can be entered by hostname as well as by IP address, e.g. `<serial number>.local`
- A wrong username or password is shown as such in the connection status

### Bug Fixes

- The settings page did not open when adding a new Pearl connection
- Changed settings (e.g. IP address or password) now take effect immediately, without restarting the connection
- With firmware 4.24.1 or newer, layouts were missing, and changing layouts, inserting markers, resetting recorders and getting or setting layout data did not work
- Streaming feedbacks from very old configurations lost their colors after updating
- Buttons and feedbacks could stop updating when the Pearl was not reachable or did not support a feature
- Presets now have proper names, and recorders with the same name each get their own presets
- Recorders without a name no longer show up as "undefined"
- The variables for resolution and bitrate stayed empty with firmware older than 4.24.1
- "Set Content Metadata" updated the metadata variables even if the Pearl rejected the new values
- The connection was shown as failed when the Pearl only rejected a single command, e.g. a marker
- Clearer error messages, e.g. when a marker can't be set because the channel is not recording
- Improved stability and error handling
